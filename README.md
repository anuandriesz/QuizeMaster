 Title: Simple iOS Quiz App Using MVC Design Pattern

Description:
This GitHub project is a learning resource for iOS development enthusiasts aiming to understand the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern through practical application. The project focuses on building a simple quiz app using Swift programming language.

The app presents users with questions, each having two options (True or False). Users can select their answers, and the app provides immediate feedback on correctness. A key feature of the app is the implementation of a score label, dynamically updating based on the number of correct answers provided by the user.
